## Prerequisites

### Linux
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install libgl-dev
sudo apt install xorg-dev
```

## How To Setup

1.	Clone using your source control provider (I use GitHub Desktop for example :octocat:).
2.	Go to `/GoodBrew/Scripts/` and run the `GenerateProjectFiles` script for your os.
3.	Premake should have generated `GB.sln` in your root folder. Open that and you should have code access now!
